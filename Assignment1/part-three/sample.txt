This is a terrible film with the worst acting I’ve ever seen in my life . Please take my advice . Don’t go to see it .
Playwright Florian Zeller’s third instalment – and second film – in a cycle that includes The Father is a muscular , devastating drama that ought to have featured more prominently in the protracted “ awards conversation ” . Alongside Till , it’s the closest thing to an old-fashioned, grown-up Oscar Best Picture winner . Tellingly , neither film is in the reckoning . It has form too . Two years ago , Zeller and Anthony Hopkins took home Academy Awards (best-adapted screenplay and best actor) for The Son’s predecessor . Hopkins returns , briefly and memorably , as a different sort of paterfamilias . “ Your daddy wasn’t nice to you . So what ? ” the Oscar-winner snaps mid-tirade at Hugh Jackman’s Peter . That is the lesser of the familial psychodramas in Zeller’s wrenching screenplay , composed with notes on English translation from Christopher Hampton (Dangerous Liaisons) .
